				<h2>Find the Best Cheap Plane Quotes </h2>
				<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
					<p>Low-cost airlines are airline companies that offer cheap tickets, at least in comparison with traditional airline companies. They work according to the ‘no frills’ concept and are therefore also called price fighters or budget airlines. This means that overhead costs are kept as low as possible, and extra services such as meals and entertainment are not included in the price. Hand baggage is allowed but must meet specific requirements (dimensions and or weight), for hold baggage you always have to pay extra. Unlike traditional airlines, low-cost airlines tend to fly to small airports, due to the lower airport and handling costs that apply to these airports.</p>
				<p>Low-cost airlines are particularly cheap when you book your airline ticket in advance. Tickets will cost less if you book them a few months before your flight than when you buy them two weeks in advance. Low-cost airlines do not offer last-minute tickets. Some traditional airlines have a subsidiary that has to compete with these low-cost airlines, for example, Transavia and HOP! which belong to Air France-KLM, and Eurowings which is part of Lufthansa. To give you more insight into flying with a low-cost airline, we have listed the pros and cons below.

				<h3>Cheaper</h3>
				<p>Low-cost airlines are, as the name suggests, cheaper than traditional airline companies. A return ticket Amsterdam – London can easily cost € 100 less, meaning you and 4 friends can save up to € 500.</p>

				<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i>
				<h3>Cheap parking</h3>
				<p>Low-cost airlines usually fly to smaller airports. This means that parking is going to be significantly cheaper, as the larger airports will charge you more for a parking space.</p>

				<i class="fa fa-book"></i>	
				<h3>Sightseeing</h3>
				<p> If the smaller airport isn’t near your destination, you will probably have to rent a car or at least arrange some form of transportation. This involves extra costs, but you don’t have to see this as wasted money. </p>

				<h4>Why do you need cheap air ticket?</h4>
				<p>You might mistakenly think that cheap airlines are cutting corners so that they can offer highly discounted prices. In reality, airline safety is all about location, not about type. This is what influences the possibility of having an accident happen. With budget airlines, you do not sacrifice safety. In fact, some might be just a little safer because of locations.</p>
				<p>This is definitely the biggest advantage that has to be mentioned when referring to flying with low cost airlines. Most of these airlines will give you very cheap tickets and they will only serve a limited number of routes. Because of the limited routes, they offer highly competitive prices. With the use of many of these flights, you can actually end up buying a ticket that is up to 80% cheaper than with large airlines. This is especially the case when booking in advance.</p>
				<p>Most airlines today run promotions and this does include those that offer really cheap fares. Such promotions are incredibly beneficial for you and they will further slash ticket prices. You can find such deals presented on the internet and there are also coupon books that feature them.</p>
